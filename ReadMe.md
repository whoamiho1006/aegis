# AEGIS 
AEGIS Framework is for crafting Blockchain, Endpoints and Predictable Workers, and Major purpose of AEGIS is Enhanced Authorization. For the AEGIS, it uses Blockchain for synchronization between enhanced authorization nodes. and each nodes keeps SQLite database for keeping its data and automatically makes 3-backward backup datas of SQLite with Blockchain signatures.

Note that this blockchain does not aim to keep the full history, but rather to maintain the integrity of SQLite.

### References
AEGIS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* Microsoft.Data.SQLite - SQLite database for .NET Core.
* SECP256K1.Net - ECDSA, SECP256K1 Implementation for signaturing of Blocks.
* [jQuery] - OAuth frontend and AJAX implementations.

And of course AEGIS itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/whoamiho1006/aegis) on GitHub.
